[Oracle Database Enterprise Edition by Oracle | Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition?tab=reviews)
  It's dissapointing to see the lack of documentation for the oracle database and the setup generel. It doesn't either provide much in the console.. i had to fish a lot of informations to get it running. You guys should at least use the default root password 'sjsysadmin' than what's provided so people can find the default informations for accounts etc. For a quick setup, you can do the following: --------------------------------------------------------------- 1. docker pull store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 2. docker run -d -p 1521:1521 --name Oracle store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1 3. Get Oracle SQL developer or use your Console through portainer Databases it creates: - ORCLPDB1 (Internal between containers) - ORCLCDB (External) Connectionstrings: INTERN: --------------------------- Host: Your ip or localhost Database: ORCLPDB1 Username: sys as sysdba Password: Oradoc\_db1 INTERN = ORCLPDB1=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=<ip-address>)(PORT=<port>)) (CONNECT\_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE\_NAME=ORCLPDB1.localdomain))) EXTERN: --------------------------- Host: your ip or localhost Database: ORCLCDB Username: sys as sysdba Password: Oradoc\_db1 EXTERN = ORCLCDB=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=<ip-address>)(PORT=<port>)) (CONNECT\_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE\_NAME=ORCLCDB.localdomain))) For use in .Net ---------------------- "Data Source=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=OracleHostname)(PORT=OraclePort))(CONNECT\_DATA=(SERVICE\_NAME=OracleDatabase)));User Id=OracleUsername;Password=OraclePassword;"; How to connect outside your container: ------------------------------------------------------ Oracle SQL Developer for ORCLPDB1 1. Add a new connection HOST: ip or localhost Username: SYS Password: Oradoc\_db1 Role: SYSDBA Port: 1521 Servicename: ORCLPDB1.localdomain Oracle SQL Developer for ORCLCDB Host: ip or localhost SID: ORCLCDB Port: 1521 Username: SYS Password: Oradoc\_db1 Role: SYSDBA How to create a new account: ------------------------------------------ if you cannot create a new account, check which instance you are on. If you are ORCLCDB and you can't, you need to change your session container. Alter session set container = 'ORCLPDB1'; Then create your account with your rights wished. If any, you can 'GRANT dba to NEWUSERNAME'; and write 'commit'; and log into this one if you don't want to use the root account 'SYS'. How to use the SYS on consoles with SQLPLUS ------------------------------------------------------------------- SQLPLUS / as sysdba
